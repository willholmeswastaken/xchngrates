Live demo: https://xchngrates.netlify.com/

XChngRates is a react application to be able to view all currencies around the world and, compare their value against a base currency.

Currently the base currency is defaulted to GBP but there is plans to make this selectable by the user in the near future.

**It is noted that unit tests are lacking at the moment, this is due to getting an mvp out asap. They will follow very soon!**
